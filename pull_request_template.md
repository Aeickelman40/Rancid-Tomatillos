Added Movie and Movies as functional components with their appropriate style and test files. Fetched data from the API within the App component. Began to get each individual movie appear within the main section, still needs styling. 
### Why is this change required? What problem does it solve?
Takes care of the bulk of iteration 1, still needs to show individual movie title and rating and error handling for bad requests aside from the .catch console.log.
